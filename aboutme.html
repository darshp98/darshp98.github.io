<p>Hi there! My name's Darshana Paramesh and I love to explore the city of New York, mostly by eating my way through it.</p>
	<p>I've always enjoyed eating all different types of cuisines, and what better place to explore this love of mine than in the greatest city in the world. This website is a collection of all of the food adventures I go on in New York.</p>
		<p>Hopefully, some of you find this helpful to go venture to new places that you've never been to before!</p>
